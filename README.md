# Security-Home-Lab

## Objective

A Security Detection Lab project 🎯 was created to build a controlled playground 🛡️ for simulating and detecting cyber attacks ⚔️. Its main goal? To ingest and analyze logs 📊 within a powerful SIEM system 🕵️‍♂️, generating realistic test telemetry 📡 that mimics real-world attack scenarios 🌐🔥. This hands-on experience 💻🔍 helps sharpen skills in network security 🛡️, uncover attack patterns 🧩, and master defensive strategies 🛠️ to stay one step ahead of cyber threats! 🚀✨
