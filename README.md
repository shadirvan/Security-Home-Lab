# Security-Home-Lab

## Objective

A Security Detection Lab project 🎯 was created to build a controlled playground 🛡️ for simulating and detecting cyber attacks ⚔️. Its main goal? To ingest and analyze logs 📊 within a powerful SIEM system 🕵️‍♂️, generating realistic test telemetry 📡 that mimics real-world attack scenarios 🌐🔥. This hands-on experience 💻🔍 helps sharpen skills in network security 🛡️, uncover attack patterns 🧩, and master defensive strategies 🛠️ to stay one step ahead of cyber threats! 🚀✨

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
