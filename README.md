# Security-Home-Lab

## Objective

A Security Detection Lab project 🎯 was created to build a controlled playground 🛡️ for simulating and detecting cyber attacks ⚔️. Its main goal? To ingest and analyze logs 📊 within a powerful SIEM system 🕵️‍♂️, generating realistic test telemetry 📡 that mimics real-world attack scenarios 🌐🔥. This hands-on experience 💻🔍 helps sharpen skills in network security 🛡️, uncover attack patterns 🧩, and master defensive strategies 🛠️ to stay one step ahead of cyber threats! 🚀✨

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
1. Download a good Hypervisor. I prefer vmware as it more stable than virtualbox.
   - [Vmware](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)
2. Choose a Linux Operating system for Installing Splunk: Here i choose debian because it is lighter and comes with less no of packages packages
   - [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)
